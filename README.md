### Project Setup

The project is a single-page static site composed on two main components: `Map` and `Modal`. The backend is handled by a Airtable Base within the MAPC organization, which stores all changes uploaded by the users and stores records of the emojis and explanations provided.

The `Map` component is used for the primary rendering that faces the user. This component handles rendering the map from the municipality .geojson data as well as rendering the representative emojis for each municipality throughout the region. This component uses the Airtable library to retrieve the data through their HTTP request API functions. This `Modal` is also responsible for handling the UI and different juice effects (particles and hover effects) that are present throughout the project.

The `Modal` component is used as a form to allow the user to submit their emoji suggestions along with a short description of their choice. This component also uses the Airtable API to submit new data which is then rendered and updated on the `Map` component. This `Modal` was built using react-bootstrap and emoji-picker-react libraries to streamline the development process.
